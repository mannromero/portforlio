                MOBILE LEGENDS BANG BANG | ONE OF MY FAVORITE MOBILE GAMES
            </p>

            <p class="para">
                    I have managed to play a lot of Online Games, and now one of my favorite is Mobile Legends Bang Bang,<br> 
                    it is gives me happiness when I able to get the Victory and Little Disappointment if got Defeated.<br> 
                    I can say that game graphics are great, as well as the sound and gameplay options. Mobile Legends is <br> 
                    also free to play mobile game, where you get rewards daily. Every time you log in, there is a reward <br> 
                    and on every three hours there is a free chest. Lately, the developers made a few updates, that <br> 
                    brought new heroes in the game.<br> <br>


                    The Mobile Legends can be further divided into six classes – Tank, Fighter, Assassin, Mage, Marksman, <br> 
                    and Support. Tanks are shields with high health points (HP) and high defense. Fighters are team brawlers <br> 
                    with the perfect balance between defense, damage, and HP. Each class is unique, and plays a different role <br> 
                    on the team. <br> <br> 


                   Tanks are the shield of the team.These heroes have high health points (HP) and high defense.With their toughness,<br> 
                   tanks break up enemy teams and help absorb damage.If you enjoy being at the front, soaking up tons of damage, <br> 
                   then the tank role is made for you. Examples of tank heroes are Tigreal, Johnson and Grock.<br> <br> 


                  Fighters are the brawlers of the team. These heroes have a good balance between HP, defense and damage. <br> 
                  Their balanced stats allow these heroes to get in and get out of fights alive.<br> 
                  If you love to be in the thick of the action while killing heroes, being a fighter is the role for you.<br> 
                  Examples of fighter heroes are Chou, Sun and Ruby. <br>
 
                  Assassins are the ninjas of the team. They have low HP but high damage, roaming the map, ambushing enemies <br> 
                  in lane. If you like being sneaky and taking down enemies, the assassin role is made for you. Examples of <br> 
                  assassin heroes are Fanny, Helcurt and Hayabusa.<br> 
 
Mages are long-range damage dealers with strong abilities. These heroes have high mana and low defense, relying <br> 
on their powerful spells to chip away at the enemy’s HP and control team fights. If you enjoy spamming spells <br> 
to annoy your opponent, picking a mage hero would suit you best. Examples of Mage heroes are Alice, Eudora <br> 
and Harith.<br> 
 
Marksmen are the hero killers of the team. These heroes have high damage but low defense and mobility. Marksmen <br> 
help eliminate enemy heroes during team fights. If you love dealing damage and killing heroes, being a marksman <br> 
is the way to go. Examples of Marksman heroes are Miya, Layla and Lesley <br> 
 
Supports are the backbone of the team. They have high mana and low defense like mages. However, their spells <br> 
keep their teammates alive. If you prefer being in the back lines and keeping your team alive, then being a <br> 
support is best for you. Examples of support heores are Angela, Diggie and Rafaela<br> <br>

<p class="para">
My most favorite class in Mobile Legends is Assassin it is agile champion that specializes in killing or <br> 
disabling roaming targets picking them of as they try to replenish HP. Focused on infiltration, deception, <br> 
and mobility, assassins are opportunistic hunters who find favorable moments within a fight before jumping <br> 
into the fray.<br> <br> 

In the assassin heros Gusion is my most favorite to use because he is very strong and deadly hero in the <br> 
early game. This has its own weaknesses, but make sure you don’t play until late game, and finish the game <br> 
quickly. The reason is, Gusion is only strong in the early game, and tends to be weak during the late game.<br> 
You can also bought your favorite skin Using Codashop, topping up is made easy, safe and convenient. We are<br> 
trusted by millions of gamers & app users in South Asia, including Bangladesh. No credit card, registration <br> 
or login is required!<br> <br> 



In order to win a Mobile Legends game, you need to destroy the Enemy Base Inhibitor. Before you can start <br> 
damaging it, you must destroy the preceding turrets in each lane. I really hate being defeated that is <br> 
why I am doing my best to win the game, but sometimes most of my teammates is not cooperating well that’s <br> 
why we always got defeated. Having fun is the reason why I played Mobile Legend, so Either win or lose the<br> 
most important thing is to be happy, enjoy the game, be positive thinking and acceptance when got defeated.<br>
